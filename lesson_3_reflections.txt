When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Some local commits may not be in final publishable form.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are locally cloned repositories on the (remote) GitHub system.
    Use when cloning to a PC is undesirable.

    Clones are full yet snapshot-in-time commit histories of a repository.
    Use when editting files locally on a PC and then pushing to the GitHub system.

    Branches are commit histories not merged to the master commit history.
    Use when developing additional functionality, debugging, etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
